Blood Relations: Report
-----------------------

Recent fixes (for side-effect reference) since 20/9/90
------------------------------------------------------

OK * Graphics oscillate when finish menu conversation.
OK * Inspector freezes his racetrack after he's met Sam.
  - TeleGoto was found to kill all return addresses, such that 
  an npc given a telegoto while executing a subroutine would 
  not return to the code which called the subroutine, after 
  the telegoto routine had ended.
OK * Intro now works out maximum possible score and rounds it 
  to the nearest hundred. The main game tweaks the score if 
  it is close to (or greater than!) the maximum score.
OK * Move all writeable tables to start of list 4, and save 
  only those necessary, rather than the whole of list 4.
OK * Npc's stand up BEHIND chairs when about to leave the room.
OK * Fiona dead at table not shown.
   - Dead flag bits not set in murders 1-4!
OK * Accuse npc, they say, e.g. Kathy said, "Kathy". & mouth animation 
  is not removed.
OK * Point evidence to people in M1-4.
OK * Adjust evidence tables for court in M1-4.
OK * Can't get menu after climbing stairs from within a "find person" 
  command.
OK * Interface maze game with main game - show the correct objects 
  as sam picks them up, and make sure he's carrying them when 
  returning to the main game.
OK * Large font - (!) instead of ( ).
OK * Sex scene begins in library!
OK * Get masonry game working properly, & also make masonry 
  hit William.
OK * Knocked out if hit by masonry.
OK * Analyse - all objects treated as insignificant.
OK * Clear text backdrop & set intro palette when going to 
  the intro from the main game.
OK * Restart new game after time-out: Immediately run out of 
  time again.
OK * Screen flashes at start & briefly shows intro scene.
OK * William prevents Sam from opening doctor's bag.
OK * Don't animate dead body - re-display room.
OK * William's body pos is too low.
OK * Whisky bottle hovers above ground M5.
OK * Electric fire is two cells too high in gatehouse.
OK * Auto-note 1st time body messages.
OK * Room heading has black border in ligher-toned indoor rooms.
OK * Display sub-game intructions over a scene from the 
  sub-game.
OK * Raster printing has a black border.
OK * Load/Save use one of 10 position files.
OK * Show sub-game instructions over game scene.
OK * Bees fly more to the left or right when they begin, to 
  lessen the chance of hitting them by repeatedly swatting the 
  hive.
OK * Load now initialises the correct tables if loading a position 
  saved from a murder other than the current one.
OK * Intro text on raster printing.

Main game bugs
--------------

M * Graphics corrupted when loading and even saving.
M * No quote in big font. Also, the dot character is too far 
  to the right and not big enough.

* Check all default objects & objects repositioned with 
  no hipos, to make sure they don't "hover".
* Text box warnings as time runs out.
* Can't climb up landing on GD to master bedroom.
* Can't climb down OR up g/house stairs on a GD.
* No ridge walk text (window too small? - Shorten text).
* When player isn't doing well...
   more frequent, (a) Auto sub-game or hint to do a sub-game
   less frequent, (b) Game hint to solving the murder (things 
   to examine, people to ask - Pete: Make this murder specific, 
   i.e. different hints for each murder?
* Menus to use raster printing & CopyScreenToBuffer.
* Main text to use raster printing.
* When Sam wins the doctor bag game, print each object found 
  from withing the sub-game overlay, & transfer their position to 
  him.
* For the maze, have a maximum of 2 objects in the maze.
  When the player hits an object, scan to see if any special 
  objects in the maze (don't have any objects with default maze 
  positions!). If none, choose a dummy one (which will have 
  a default pos of room 0). Set vars MazeObject and MazeObject1 
  to the objects picked up. If Sam wins, give him the objects, 
  if he loses, clear MazeObject and MazeObject1 (which should 
  be done whenever the maze game is started, anyway).
* Make Jarvis carry drinks tray in serving racetrack and at start 
  of murder 5, and in other murders where he e.g. serves 
  breakfast.

Murder specific bugs
--------------------

Murder 1
--------

Murder 2
--------

Murder 3
--------

Murder 4
--------

Murder 5
--------

* Clifford repeatedly dials phone / goes on Library RT!
* William has blank conversation after he sees Kathy dead
SQUASH * Noose messages mixed up - message.txt says "penknife", table2.txt 
  says "long rope", BUT when noted, it is correctly referred to 
  as "a noose"

Sub game bugs
-------------

* Time-out clock is shown in front of doctor bag graphic.
* Bees sometimes sting in wrong place. Because big stinging bee 
  is not within the range 965-985, which is used to set 
  BeeX and BeeY?
* Bees usually always fly to the right (random path? Why not just 
  use one path).

Floormaps
---------

* Top left corner of library - make small S chair alcove flush 
  with S sofa.
* Left side of table in study.
* Plant pot in downstairs corridor.
* Landing.
* Desk in Robert's room.
* Bee hive.
* Southeast corner in entrance hall - make chair access easier.

Graphics
--------

* Please could we have people's legs attached to their eating 
  animations, and Fiona when she's dead (2191).
* Jarvis dusting/polishing animation, in all directions.
* Broken window wrong (too small a hole).
* The sex scene animation no longer works (the portrait stuff).
* For some of the smaller rooms, could we have some sort of border? 
  There is too much contrast between the edge of the room and the 
  black background. This is emphasised by the main text window, which 
  remains the full screen width.
