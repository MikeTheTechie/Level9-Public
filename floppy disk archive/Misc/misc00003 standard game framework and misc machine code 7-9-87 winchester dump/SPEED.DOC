                    Appendix F - Hardware Performance

The  following timings were performed on a 520STM,  using a Cumana 
double  sided floppy,  and the Argonaut Winchester.  They refer to 
the version of Worm in Paradise used in Silicon Dreams.


Function                 Accumulated time

                           From floppy         From Winchester

run editor,
load aspecial,
save it,
quit back to CLI.             0:38                0:12             

time at end of compile:       1:19                0:30

time at end of finish:        1:41                0:36

run game, return to CLI       1:58                0:43

The last figure gives the 'development cycle' time.  It is clearly 
about three times faster from Winchester.

Costs of the various hardware configurations are approx:

                                   Price incl. VAT
     520STM                             300
     Double sided drive                 140
     B/W monitor                        150
     Colour monitor                     300
     Winchester drive                   600

     520STM, Double sided drive, own monitor or TV.
                              Cost about 400 pounds incl.

     520STM, Double sided drive, winchester, monitor.
                              Cost about 1300 pounds incl.

Over a typical working day, with one compilation every ten minutes 
on average,  using a Winchester would save about 2 hours. Over the 
two  months  or so to develop a game,  this is about 80 hours,  or 
approx  two weeks.  For a salaried programmer earning 12000 pounds 
pa,  this  is  500  pounds,  or slightly less than the cost  of  a 
Winchester. Thus a Winchester system is (just) cost-beneficial for 
developing a single game from start to finish.
