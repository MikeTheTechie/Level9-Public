         GRANGE MURDER DESIGN NOTES. 27/7/87. LEVEL 9

BACKGROUND

"Grange Murder" is an animated adventure from Level 9. It has a 
short playing time, but contains nine alternative crimes to solve 
can therefore be played several times. 

The display consists of:
* 3D graphic window, filling most of the screen, within which the 
  player and other people move. There are about 20 "backgrounds". 
* Pull-down menus to enter commands. 
* Text window, about 4 lines, with further information about what 
  is displayed. 

It will be a 16-bit game. If we do 8-bit versions (which is possible 
I expect) they will have static graphics.
