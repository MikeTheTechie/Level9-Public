    NINE GREEN MURDERS OUTLINE. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 LEVEL 9
    ------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN OUTLINE 

"Nine Green Murders" is the first game to use Level 9's new animated 
adventure system for 16-bit micros. This is a bit like Sierra 
On-line's "Leisure Suit Larry" or "Police Quest" system, but with: 
* unrivalled compression, 
* huge sprites and lots of 3D animation, 
* lengthy background music and digitised sound effects, 
* control by pull-down menus, 
* the advanced features of Level 9's traditional adventures: 
  realistic "game people", UNDO, SAVE/RESTORE, RAM SAVE/RESTORE etc. 
 
The display occasionally changes to show close-ups, but normally 
it consists of:
* 3D graphic window, filling most of the screen, within which the 
  player and other people move. There are about 20 "backgrounds". 
* Pull-down menus to enter commands. 
* Scrolling text window, about 6 lines, with further information 
  about what is displayed and details of what people say etc. 

"Nine Green Murders" is a murder mystery, set at a family reunion in 
a large and mysterious country house. You are there to advise on the 
security of the estate but, when one of the family dies mysteriously 
you are called upon to solve the crime. There are nine alternative 
murders, with a wide range of difficulties, so the game can be 
played many times.
