   NINE GREEN MURDERS DISTRACTIONS. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 LEVEL 9
   -----------------------------------------------------------

When the current plot requires the player to be away from a 
particular location (eg if they are hanging about waiting for the 
murder to happen) a distraction will be arranged. 

Normally, Jarvis will arrive with an urgent message and lead the 
player away (you have no option). But Jarvis may be busy (or the 
murderer/victim) and in this case, and occasionally anyway, someone 
else will bring the message. 

Possible distractions include 'phone calls from home.. 
* Spouse: where are you? Why not back home? A: on lucrative job. 
* Spouse: where did you hide the tv remote control. 
* Spouse:  "     "   "   "    "  housekeeping? 
* Spouse:  "     "   "   "    "  spagetti jar? 
* Kid: hello mummy/daddy etc... 
* Spouse: your parole officer wants a word. A: Shhh! 
* Spouse: a couple of policemen called in. A: will contact station. 
* Kid: happy birthday! 
* Spouse: have you remembered our anniversary? (No.) 
* Spouse: when will you be home? A: tommorrow. S: dinner's in dog. 

Or 'phone call from secretary in the office: 
* mistress/lover 'phoned; shall I give them your number there? 
* VAT inspectors tramping all over the place. A: stall them. 
* landlord has been in again after the rent. 
* how about paying me? 
* the Martian ambassador is here. Insists on talking to the boss. 
* Al asks if you're interested in a dozen mixed video recorders. 
* bailiffs here. A: don't let them in. 
* another job's come in. A: will have to wait. 
* if it's OK with you, I'll take the rest of the day off. 
* oops, sorry. You told me not to call there didn't you. 

Or events at the manor: 
* prowler seen in garden. 
* smoke detector sounds in kitchen. 
* caller at door, selling window locks. 
* policeman at door to hassle player, "Doing well for an ex-con". 
* had to go to bathroom. 
* suddenly remember car lights on. 
* remember to 'phone office. 
* think something's turned on and 'phone home. 
* fear that car is left unlocked. 
* hear barking dog outside and go to investigate. 

I suggest that these be defined by a table, with the message 
given by whoever leads you away, where you are led and the 
message output when you get there. 

The hard thing will be to limit the player's freedom of movement 
as little as possible, but without risking them seeing the 
preparation or aftermath of the crime directly. It will require 
care when programming.
