
       GRANGE MURDER SYSTEM. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 LEVEL 9
       ------------------------------------------------


INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEM 

"Grange Murder" is the first game to use Level 9's new animated 
adventure system for 16-bit micros. This is a bit like Sierra 
Online's "Leisure Suit Larry" or "Police Quest" system, but with: 
* unrivalled compression, 
* huge sprites and lots of 3D animation, 
* lengthy background music and digitised sound effects, 
* control by pull-down menus, 
* the advanced features of Level 9's traditional adventures: 
  realistic "game people", UNDO, SAVE/RESTORE, RAM SAVE/RESTORE etc. 
 


DISPLAY 

The display occasionally changes to show close-ups, but normally 
it consists of:
* 3D graphic window, (140 by 320 pixels), within which the player 
  and other (64*32 pixel) people move. This view is overlayed in 
  the extreme foreground by a face (the hero or the person 
  interacted with) and a status box, at top right and left. 
* Pull-down menus to enter commands (not always visible). 
* Scrolling text window, about 6 lines, with further information 
  about what is displayed and details of what people say etc.

The large sprites (people are typically 64*32 pixels) allows for 
smooth animation. And, allied with a fast rate of 8 frames per sec 
(not bottom-end IBMs), this gives great realism. 

When showing close-ups, the game is paused and the graphic window 
is replaced by what the hero sees. In this mode, the joystick (etc) 
cannot move the hero and so it always moves a pointer (as below).



JOYSTICK INPUT 

The game is controlled by joystick, mouse or keyboard. 

Normally, when using the joystick, you move it to make the hero go 
in that direction. 

Where possible, things happen by default (e.g walking into a door 
opens it) but this only copes with a few actions. For the rest, 
press fire to pull down menus over the text below the main picture. 

Then the hero stops moving (unless you have previously entered a 
goal-directed movement command, such as "follow") and the joystick 
moves a highlight cursor around the menus. Press fire to select the 
current highlit option, which may just replace that menu by another 
of course, but eventually you will choose a command (even if it's 
just "exit"). 

When you have selected a command then the menus are removed, the 
command is typed in the text window and passed to the game, and you 
go back to using the joystick to move the hero. 



MOUSE AND KEYBOARD INPUT 

By default, moving the mouse or pressing a cursor key corresponds 
to a pushing the joystick in that direction, and pressing the left 
mouse button or space is the same as "fire". 

Thus the game is controlled as with the joystick except that, the row could scroll horizontally when the end 
is reached. 

Only one menu is displayed at a time (superimposed on the top of 
the text, below the currently selected title) and the highlight 
pointer can be moved vertically down it. If necessary, because 
there are too many options to fit, the menu could scroll vertically 
(though the titles row would not move). 

To select an option, move the hightlight pointer over it and press 
fire. If this just selects a deeper level of menu, this replaces the row could scroll horizontally when the end 
is reached.

pointer can be moved vertically down it. If necessary, because 
there are too many options to fit, the menu could scroll vertically 
(though the titles row would not move). 

To select an option, move the hightlight pointer over it and press 
fire. If this just selects a deeper level of menu, this replaces 
the old. (To abandon the menu and return to the top level, move the 
pointer up to the menu title). Eventually you will select an option 
which completes an action, whereapon the action is carried out and 
you return to the game. 

The Menu structure could be as follows: 

       SAVE       THINGS   POSSESSIONS PEOPLE  SYSTEM 
       UNDO                                    QUIT 
       RAM SAVE    list       list      list   CREDITS 
       RAM LOAD     of         of        of    TEXT SIZE 
       SAVE       things     things    people  MUSIC OFF 
       LOAD      on ground    held             PAUSE 

Only objects within reach are displayed in the list. On selecting 
one, the menu shows possible actions, presumably from a table, eg: 
* full glass:    drop, examine, taste, drink, empty. 
* gun:           drop, examine, fire, empty.
* gun on ground: get, examine. 
* open door:     close, examine. 

The same sort of thing happens on selecting a person, e.g: 
* person: speak, examine, follow.
